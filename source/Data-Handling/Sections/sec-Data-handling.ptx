    <title>Meaning of data</title>
       <p>
           Data is a collection of facts such as numbers and measurements that we learn, make decisions or solve problems.
       </p> 
        <p>
            An example of data in a market could be the information collected about what customers buy and how much they spend. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Moraa owns a fruit stall, and she records the following information for one day:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Customer Names: Ekadeli, Mbasu, Baya</li>
            <li>Items Bought: Apples, Bananas, Oranges</li>
            <li>Quantity: 5 apples, 3 bananas, 2 oranges</li>
            <li>Price Paid: Ksh250, ksh100, ksh150</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This information is data because it tells you what your customers bought, how much they bought, and how much they spent.
            You could use this data to figure out things like:
            <ul>
                <li>Which fruit was bought the most?</li>
                <li>How much money you earned in a day.</li>
                <li>What to stock more of next time to meet demand.</li>   
            </ul>
        </p>
       <p>
           This is how data helps businesses make decisions.

    <title>Collection of data</title>
    <p>
        A collection of data refers to the process of gathering and assembling relevant pieces of information or facts from various sources for analysis or use.
    </p>
    <p>
        This data can be quantitative (numerical) or qualitative (descriptive) and is typically organized in a structured manner to allow for efficient examination or decision-making.
    </p> 
    <p>
        Data collection can take many forms, such as:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Surveys and questionnaires: Gathering responses from individuals</li>
        <li>Experiments: Recording observations or measurements during controlled experiments.</li>
        <li>Interviews: Collecting qualitative data through direct interactions.</li>

    <p>
        A frequency distribution table displays the frequency of each data set in an organized way.
    </p>
    <p>
        It helps us to find patterns in the data and also enables us to analyze the data using measures of central tendency and variance.

           <p>
            Bar graph is a visual representation of data where individual bars (rectangular shapes) are used to represent the values or frequencies of different categories.
        </p>
        <p>
            The length or height of each bar corresponds to the value it represents, making it easy to compare different categories.

            Line graph of data is a visual representation of data where individual data points are connected by straight lines, showing how a variable changes over time or across a continuous scale, typically with the horizontal axis representing time and the vertical axis representing the measured values.

            It is used to identify trends and patterns in data over a period of time.
